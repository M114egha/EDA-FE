EDA and Feature Engineering Projects

This repository contains project focused on practising EDA &  Feature Engineering.Each project involves analyzing different datasets to extract insights and understand both numerical and categorical features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Techniques to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses using visual and statistical methods.
- Feature Engineering: Methods to create, modify, and select relevant features to improve model performance.
- Diverse Datasets: Projects utilize a range of datasets to demonstrate versatility in handling different data types and structures.
- Insightful Visualizations: Graphical representations to effectively communicate data insights and findings.
